This resource pack is created by one or more of the mods you're using. The mod
will automatically download updated translations and place them in this resource
pack; activate the resource pack to use them.

If you don't want this, and don't want the resource pack to be re-generated,
rename the pack.mcmeta file to disable.mcmeta. In Windows, if you have 
extensions turned off, you'll only see "pack" as file name, rename that file to
"disable" then.
